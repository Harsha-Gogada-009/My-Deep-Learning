# My-Deep-Learning

Repository for my deep learning practice models, concepts, and experiments.

This repository contains my implementations of various deep learning concepts, models, and experiments. It serves as a personal learning space where I explore different architectures, frameworks, and techniques.  

## ðŸ“Œ Contents  

- **Neural Networks** - Basic implementations of perceptrons, MLPs, and activation functions.  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - Image classification, object detection, and feature extraction.  
- **Optimization Techniques** - SGD, Adam, learning rate scheduling, and regularization.  
- **Custom Datasets & Preprocessing** - Data augmentation, feature scaling, and custom dataset loaders.  
- **PyTorch & TensorFlow Implementations** - Hands-on coding with both frameworks.
- **Problems and Datasets I worked on with** -
